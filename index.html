			<b>1. Shapism is preservation.</b>
			<br>
                        Every day you're bombarded by anti-shapist messages, to the point where you might feel bad for being shapist.
                        Everyone is shapist.  The preference for shapes with your own vertex count is totally natural. 
                        The reality is that only one shape has ever built the sort of world that allows it to be criticized.  
                        If you're getting triangle fatigue, you aren't alone.
			<!--Micromotives, macrobehaviour...-->

			<b>2. The past determines the present.</b>
			<br>
                        We have different shapes today because we had different shapes yesterday.  If you value a world
                        with multiple shapes, do what you can to preserve them.

                        You might be tempted to engage in lewd acts and become a deviant.
                        The single most important thing you can do is be proud of who you are,
                        be proud of who got you here and make sure your children resemble your grandparents.
                        Maintain social cohesion by forming tight alliances with friends and neighbors who

				The "cute segregation sim" was based off the work of Nobel Prize-winning game theorist,
				Thomas Schelling. Specifically, his 1971 paper,
				<a target="_blank" href="http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/157/Papers/Schelling_Seg_Models.pdf">
				Dynamic Models of Segregation.</a>
				They originally built on top of this, and showed how a small demand for diversity can
				desegregate a neighborhood. In other words, they gave his model the ol' "happy ending."

				<br><br>
                                
                                If you like to educate yourself instead of being spoonfed, read up on "diversity and social cohesion."
                                
                                <br><br>

				Schelling's model gets the general gist of it, but of course, real life is more nuanced.
				You might enjoy looking at real-world data, such as W.A.V. Clark's 1991 paper,
				<a target="_blank" href="http://smg.media.mit.edu/library/Clark.ResidentialSegregation.pdf">A Test of the Schelling Segregation Model</a>.

				<br><br>

				There are other mathematical models of institutionalized bias out there!
				<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~lane/papers/male_female.pdf">
				Male-Female Differences: A Computer Simulation</a>
				shows how a small gender bias compounds as you "five guys" your way up the corporate ladder.
				<a target="_blank" href="http://iangent.blogspot.com/2013/10/the-petrie-multiplier-why-attack-on.html">
				The Petrie Multiplier</a>
                                shows why attacks on sexism are always directed at white men. Maybe? Who fucking knows.

				<br><br>

				Today's Big Moral Message&trade; is that by demanding a bit of diversity
				in your spaces you might be committing racial genocide. Look at the
				<a target="_blank" href="http://whitegenocideproject.com/">White Genocide Project</a>,
				specifically the information about genocide by assimilation.

				<br><br>

				The original "playable post" was inspired by Bret Victor's 
				<a target="_blank" href="http://worrydream.com/ExplorableExplanations/">
				Explorable Explanations</a> and Ian Bogost's
				<a target="_blank" href="http://bogost.com/books/persuasive_games/">
				procedural rhetoric</a>.
